    <h1>About</h1>
<p>Welcome to the official website for Braden G. Kane.</p>
<p>I am from Holyoke, Massachusetts and attend Wheaton College as a Film and New Media major. </p>
<p>In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my friends, going snowboarding, play guitar, filming and editing videos, and more.</p> 
<br>
<p>On this site, you will be keeping up with my journey into the world of digital fabrication. I am rather new the subject as a whole, </p>
<p>but the wide array of fields offered in the course such as 3D Printing to using a laser cutter have always had my interest, and I wish </p> 
<p>to expand and grow my knowledge on them and the many other assignments I encounter. Enjoy!</p>

    <h3><span class="w3-xlarge w3-border-red w3-bottombar">Week 1: Making a Website</span></h3>
  <p>For the first week's assignment, our task was to curate our own website for our work.</p> 
  <br>
  <p>To begin, I first needed to grasp the concepts of HTML and CSS.</p>
  <p>HTML is the language for designing what is seen on the web browser. </p>
  <p>It goes hand and hand with the other digital language of CSS.<p>
  <br>
<p>I started out by installing a few different items first: Visual Studio code,</p>
<p>Git via my terminal, and the brackets extension. Next up was setting up the repository </p>
<p>for my website through GitHub Pages. Git allows for the creation of an empty repository.</p> 
<p>After some use of terminal, it was set up and ready for the next step. <p>
    <img src="Repository.png" style="width:35%" >
<br>
<br>
<p>Setting up the index.html took some time. It involved the uses of committing, staging changes,</p> 
<p>and pushing functions. After a change is made to the code, you press save. Next, I went over to the changes</p>
<p>section and staged them. Then, I had to commit them. To do so, I had to type any command into the message bar,</p>
<p>then press commit. Pushing is a function on VSC that allows the user to make the changes go live. Pulling on the</p>
<p>other hand,takes those changes back and removing them from the live version of the site. Cloning is another function</p>
<p>which allows you to make copies of selected elements within the html code. Had a little bit of diffculty</p>
<p>navigating through this step, but was able to figure it out in the end.<p>
    <img src="HelloWorld.png" style="width:35%" >
<br>
<br>
<p> Moving along, the next step was finding a good template to use. I went on to the W3 school's website and found this one.<p>
    <img src="Choosing template.png" style="width:35%" >
<br>
<br>
<p> I made changes to the template via the Tryit Editor on W3's site until adjusted them to my liking.<p>
  <p>It worked effectively at letting me see instant changes to what the site would appear like,</p>
  <p>rather than having to push out each individual change on VSC and waiting for the site to update it.</p>
    <img src="ChangingTemplate.png" style="width:35%">
    <br>
    <br>
<p>I added an About Me page, Weekly Assignment Pages, Final Assignment page, as well as a Contact section.</p>
<img src="AboutMeAssignments.png" style="width:35%">
<img src="FinalContact.png" style='width:35%'>
<br>
<br>
<p>Finally, I copied the template code and pasted it into my index.html file on VSC. Now just time to commit</p>
<p>and push to see all the changees go live!<p>
    <img src="Final Step.png" style="width:35%">
<br>
<br>
<p>As you can see, I was able to get my website up and running smoothly. The process wasn't the easiest, but the outcome was</p>
<p>all worth it in the end. My own site, pretty cool!</p>

    <h3><span class="w3-xlarge w3-border-red w3-bottombar">Week 2: CNC Routing</span></h3>
  <p>Week two gave us light to the first hands on assignment in the course.</p>
  <p>Before beginning this assignment, I received training to use the handheld cutter.</p>
  <br>
  <p>First, I went onto Autodesk fusion 360. This was our first assignment involving</p>
  <p>the use of the application. It is a CAD/CAM software used for product design/development.</p>
  <p>Here, I was able to design the sketch for my personalized organizer.</p>
  <img src="FusionRouterTop.png" style="width:40%">
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>After the sketch was complete, I went into the render mode </p>
  <p>to alter the appearance of my piece. In this mode, I was able to change the material you are</p>
  <p> using (mahogany, cherry, pine wood, etc.) and much more.</p>
<img src="CNCRoutingFusion.jpg" style="width:40%">
<br>
<br>
<p>Then, I switched on over to Adobe Illustrator. The main goal here was to prepare </p>
<p>an .svg file for the shaper to cut. I pasted an image in of the shaper origin illustrator </p>
<p>guide to help me identify the colors corresponding to each cut. Example: Black = Exterior cut, </p>
<p>Gray = Pocket cut, etc. Now, I am ready to use the shaper and begin the cutting!</p>
<img src="SOIG.png" style="width:35%">
<br>
<br>
<p>To start using the shaper, I followed this list of steps:</p>
<br>
<p>1. Vacuum the surface.</p>
<p>2. Double-side tape the back. (No double-sided tape available, used 4 screws.)</p>
<p>3. Drill holes and then screws into corners secure board into place (Change screwhead </p>
<p>first and it is crucial that crew is below surface material)</p>
<p>4. Insert the correct endmill by twisting the rod to loosen it from the shaper.</p>
<img src="ShaperSteps.png" style="width:30%">
<p>5. Using a wrench, twist and turn to the left on the endmill to loosen it and change the</p>
<p>spindle screw.</p>
<img src="ShaperSteps2.png" style="width:30%">
<p>6. Put the new screw into spindle down at least 2/3’s into the endmill. Next, holding down</p>
<p>button on it, twist to the right with wrench to secure it back on (let off button when it gets</p> 
<p>stiff to turn).</p>
<img src="ShaperSteps3.png" style="width:30%">
<p>7. Place the endmill back onto the shaper, attach the cord back and twist the rod to secure it </p>
<p>back on.</p>
<img src="ShaperSteps4.png" style="width:30%">
<p>8. Insert the USB into the shaper.</p>
<p>9. Turn the shaper on, start a new scan, import and place design.</p>
<p>10. Create cut settings -> 0.25in -> Pocket Engrave -> 0.25in Z touch</p>
<p>11. Make sure the vacuum is connected to shaper before turning on spindle and making cuts.</p>
<br>
<p>The cutting process took some time, but I reached a final product that I was happy with.</p>
<p>I unscrewed the screws from my personalized organizer, retrieved it from the station, sanded </p>
<p>up the edges, and then  vacuumed everything up. The piece was complete!</p>
<img src="CNCRouting.jpg" style="width:25%">
<br>
<img src="Personalizedholder.jpg" style='width:25%'>
<br>
<br>
<p>On some side notes, there were a few things I wish to have fixed/changed for my organizer.</p>
<p>I wanted to keep my edges filleted on my holder, but unfortunately was unable to do so due to the placement of the screws </p>
<p>(No double-sided tape left, so I had to screw each corner down). Also, the pocket cuts could of been a little bit more precise</p>
<p>and free of the ridges you see. Besides these minor inconveniences, I am happy with the final product. As you can see, it holds</p>
<p>a phone, pens, etc. quite nicely! The circle and the way my initials came out make for a nice finish. I plan to fix the pocket cuts</p>
<p>and potenitally cut out the circle into a pcoket cut as well.</p>

    <h3><span class="w3-xlarge w3-border-red w3-bottombar">Week 3: FDM Printing</span></h3>
    <p>For week 3, our assignment was to 3D print a pot which is able to fit in our personalized holder.</p>
    <p>This was my first assignment involving the 3D printers, so I had to receive the training to do so prior.</p>
    <br>
    <p>The first step in the process for designing a pot was to measure the diameter of the circle in my holder,</p>
    <p>which was roughly 3 inches. This is to make sure that my pot will fit within my CNC holder. To start the design,</p>
    <p>I went opened up the Fusion 360 application and began to follow along the tutorial on our class website for creating</p>
    <p>a pot.</p>
    <img src="Fusion360.png" style="width:30%">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>During this process, I had to design sketches, use the extrude and fillet features, and more. I started my pot by</p>
    <p>using the circular pattern tool and adjusted the circumference. Next, I extruded the center of the pot until it was at a</p>
    <p>good enough height. I also ended up and added supports because my pot extruded outward. After I finished designing the pot's</p>
    <p>design in Fusion, I exported it as an .stl file.</p>
    <img src="ViewPot.gif" style="width:20%">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Now, it is almost time to print out my pot. I went over to the fiber lab, powered up one of the Macs, and opened up the PrusaSlicer </p>
    <p>application to view my print.</p>
    <img src="PrusaSlicer.png" style="width:40%">
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>Using this application, it let me view my design layer by layer to make sure it would print correctly. After this was done, I exported</p>
    <p>it as a G-code to an SD card for the MK3 Mini printer to read. Next, I waited for the printer to warm up and then loaded on silver filament.</p>
    <p>From here, I then selected the file that I want it to print. As required, I waited 30 minutes by the printer to ensure that is working properly.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <img src="fdmpot.png" style="width:25%">
    <img src="fdmpottop.png" style='width:25%'>
    <br>
  <p>Here is the final result. It took a total of 15 hours to print out my pot. It has a nice silver finish and fits with my CNC Holder nicely.</p>

      <h3><span class="w3-xlarge w3-border-red w3-bottombar">Week 4: SLA Printing</span></h3>
      <p>SLA printing, also known as Stereolithography and resin printing, is a</p>
      <p>certain method of 3Dprinting that uses a light source to turn liquid resin into a hard plastic.</p>
      <br>
      <img src="RingChoices.png" style="width:30%">
      <p>I had the choice between 3 designs with tutorials that were offered, and</p>
      <p>I chose the one for the spinning ring. After deciding on the spinning design, I opened</p>
      <p>up Fusion 360 to begin following along with the tutorial for the ring.</p>
      <img src="SpnningRingTutorial.png" style="width:50%">
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>The video tutorial for the spinning ring was quite fast and often difficult to follow at some points, so I slowed</p>
      <p>down the playback speed to help keep me at pace. I learned how to use some new tools in Fusion </p>
      <br>
      <p>After I was finished in Fusion, I exported it as an .stl file and then put in</p>
      <p>our Google drive folder for it to be printed out. Due to the hazards of the process (resin</p>
      <p>leaks causing skin rashes, irratation, etc.), there are no trainings for using the machine and</p> 
      <p>are handled by Adminastrator/TAs only.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I had to detach it from the supports but it came off nicely. Unfortunately, (according to one of the TAs) it was unable to spin due to a layering issue<p>
      </p>when being printed out. Nonetheless, it still makes for a cool and unique ring!</p>

        <h3><span class="w3-xlarge w3-border-red w3-bottombar">Week 5: Vinyl Cutting</span></h3>
      <p>By definition, digital fabrication involves a design process mixing together 3D modeling</p>
      <p>or computer-assisted designs. The process of vinyl cutting uses of these elements together; creating a design</p>
      <p>on a computer, sending it to a machine to be cut, and then placing what it cuts onto another object.</p>
      <br>
      <p>For my shirt’s design, I wanted it to be Pokémon themed. I decided to choose the ghost/poison</p>
      <p>type pokemon Gengar. Ever since I was a kid, I have always had an obsession to the brand and its iconic</p>
      <p>characters. My friends and I even started playing Pokemon Go again here on campus recently. It’s been a </p>
      <p>really fun way to pass the time!</p>
      <br>
      <img src="VinylGengar.png" style="width:20%">
      <p>I opened up Adobe Illustrator and created a new blank file. Next, I downloaded a png of Gengar,</p> 
      <p>which worked well due to its transparent background. I had to do an image trace—>expand to make it its own object on the</p>
      <p>file. A vector image is an image that is defined by mathematical terms and connects its lines together to create shapes. A raster image</p>
      <p>is a bitmap image that is viewable on most computer/electronic screens. The cutter uses images defined be these elements to create your cut.</p>
      <p>Next, I used the text feature and typed out “Gotta catch ‘em all” in the classical Pokemon styled font. Once again, I image trace—>expand for</p>
      <p>the text. I exported it as a png file and saved it to my flash drive.</p>
      <img src="VinylIllustrator.png" style="width:40%">
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>After my file was complete, I headed over to the fiber lab to use the machine. I plugged in my flash drive </p>
      <p>to upload my design onto the computer used for vinyl cutting. I pressed cut to send over my design to the cutter, and began </p>
      <p>the next few steps of the process.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Before using the vinyl cutter, I first cut out a piece of apparel vinyl with the right proportions to fit my design, </p>
      <p>and then loaded it on, making sure it’s clamped down securely.</p>
      <br>
      <p>Next, I set the speed and force on the cutter. With apparel vinyl, the speed stays at 12m/s and the force being at 93gs. </p>
      <p>After the machine finished the cut, I removed the vinyl, threw away any leftover material, and begin peeling off the parts that </p>
      <p>I would not need on the shirt. </p>
      <br>
      <p>Now, it was time to use the heat press to place my design on my shirt. Before beginning, I waited about 15 minutes for the heat press </p>
      <p>to fully turn on/heat to rise up after switching on the power. Once it was ready, I placed down the shirt flatly and gave it an iron. I then </p>
      <p>prepared my Pokemon design over the ironed shirt, making sure everything was nice and center. </p>
      <img src="VinylShirt2.jpeg" style="width:30%">
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>Never touch the top of the press, place shirt down flatly and hold down for 5 seconds. After it was pressed, I peeled the remaining piece </p>
      <p>of the sticky side of the vinyl.<p>
        <img src="VinylShirt.jpeg" style="width:25%">
        <img src="VinylShirt3.jpeg" style='width:25%'>
      <br>

      <p>My shirt is now complete and looks great!</p>

          <h3><span class="w3-xlarge w3-border-red w3-bottombar">Week 6: Laser Cutting</span></h3>
        <p>Welcome to Laser Cutting week!</p>
        <p>To begin the assignment, I first had to choose from one of the box designs</p>
        <p>on the generator website. </p>
        <img src="LaserBoxPicking.png" style="width:30%">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I chose the option for boxes with lids. Next, I changed the thickness of the box to around 3.20mm. After the template</p>
        <p>was created, I saved it as an .svg file.</p>
        <img src="LaserBoxPicking2.png" style="width:50%">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I then went on over and opened the file in Adobe Illustrator. Here, I added my initials onto the box and rastered</p>
        <p>them as their own object so they don’t get cut through. It is now ready to be exported as in and then opened in for the cut.</p>
        <br>
        <p>I opened the tray beneath where the laser cutter is for the plywood needed to create my box. I used a piece of 1/8” birch plywood</p>
        <p>from the drawer labeled “free use” and then scanned it to the cutter. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Before starting the cut, I turned on the air filter to lower the chances of a fire. When using the cutter, you must stay within the</p>
        <p>rectangular area and keep good watch to prevent fires from occurring.</p>
        <img src="LaserCutter.gif" style="width:20%">
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>My design took around 8-10 minutes to be cut. Once the cutter was completed</p>
        <p>with my design, I powered the it down and turned off the air filter. I removed the pieces</p> 
        <p>of my box from the tray and began assembling it together. Since I forgot to edit the lid settings</p>
        <p>on the generator, I had to imrovise. I cut out an extra small square piece to be used as a cover over</p>\
        <p>my box. Here is the finished product.</p>
